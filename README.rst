Python bindings to the Neutron API
==================================

This is a client library for Neutron built on the Neutron API. It
provides a Python API (the ``neutronclient`` module) and a command-line tool
(``neutron``).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined in the
`developer guide <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html>`_.
